Oryx Process Engine (also called Dalmatina Engine (if you got a new name please email us))

This is a process engine developed by 6 students of the Hasso-Plattner-Institute, Potsdam Germany, as part of our Bachelor Project.

The goal of this process engine is to be highly extensible and pluggable.
Yes those are a bunch of buzzword but we try to reach those goals by working mainly with interfaces. We also try to point you to specific extension points in a more verbose documentation which is yet to come (our Bachelor Theses).

Don't be afraid to contact us if you got a question.
